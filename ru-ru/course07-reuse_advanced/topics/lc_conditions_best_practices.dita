            <p><b>Do not filter sentence fragments</b></p>
            <p>As described in the basic course on reusing elements, do not use filtering on
                anything smaller than a sentence. </p>
            <p>It’s better to have two instances of an entire sentence that are grammatically
                correct (and will remain correct when translated) than to risk ending up with poorly
                constructed—or even non-sensical—sentences.</p>
            <p><b>Communicate your choices</b></p>
            <p>Create a style guide or some other form of documentation so that everyone on your
                team, organization, or company uses conditional attributes and values consistently. </p>
            <p>Make sure you have agreement on:<ul id="ul_anz_mxg_vx">
                    <li>How and why everyone uses the audience, platform, product, and otherprops
                        attributes. </li>
                    <li>The precise values everyone uses with those attributes and the meaning of
                        each value. Remember that case matters when comparing attribute values with
                        the val attribute in ditaval file. </li>
                </ul></p>
            <p><b>Consider specialization</b></p>
            <p>If the there are not enough conditional attributes for your needs, or if the names of
                the attributes do not fit with how you are using them, consider using the DITA
                specialization mechanisms to create additional conditional attributes. </p>
