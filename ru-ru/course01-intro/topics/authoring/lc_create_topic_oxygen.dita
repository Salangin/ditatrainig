        <lcInstruction><p>Reading a DITA file in a text editor can be a bit of a challenge. The
                important information doesn’t stand out, and the hierarchy of the elements may not
                be apparent (because spaces and carriage returns have no meaning to XML). Most
                people find it much easier to use a visual editor (such as SyncROSoft &lt;oXygen/>)
                to edit DITA files, where the content of the DITA file is presented in a moderately
                formatted form.</p><note>A visual editor such as &lt;oXygen/> may look like a word
                processor, but the formatting that you see on screen is just one possibility of the
                way the final output will be presented. Do not rely on the appearance of text (line
                ends, fonts, character styles, and so on) as the way your content will look when
                published. </note><p>To create a topic in oXygen, follow these steps:</p><ol
                id="ol_gl3_tzq_bs">
                <li>Click the New icon (<image href="../../media/authoring/oxygen_new_icon.png"
                        base="2015/07" id="image_jqz_d1r_bs"/>).</li>
                <li>Navigate to Framework Templates/DITA/Topic, click the Topic entry, then click
                    Create. oXygen creates a new topic with some placeholder content:</li>
            </ol><pre>&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
&lt;!DOCTYPE topic PUBLIC "-//OASIS//DTD DITA Topic//EN" "topic.dtd">
&lt;topic id="topic_xks_f1r_bs">
  &lt;title>&lt;/title>
  &lt;body>
    &lt;p>&lt;/p>
  &lt;/body>
&lt;/topic>
</pre><p>oXygen
                creates a unique topic ID automatically. You can change it to something meaningful
                if you want to, but remember that IDs need to be unique and must adhere to strict
                rules. In the Author view, with tags turned on, you see this:<draft-comment
                    author="okeefe">It occurs to me what I really want is a video version of
                    this.</draft-comment></p><image href="../../media/authoring/oxygen_editor.png"
                base="2015/07" id="image_vgb_q1r_bs"/><p>You can now click inside the p (which is a
                placeholder for a &lt;p> tag) and start typing in your content. To create a new
                paragraph, press Return twice. If you want to switch to another element, press
                Return once and choose from the drop-down menu that appears at your cursor
                location.</p></lcInstruction>
